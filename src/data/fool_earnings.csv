NDAQ,Why Nasdaq Stock Fell 9.6% This Week,"Jun 16, 2023",12:34PM,2023-11-28 07:30:36.428407,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/16/why-nasdaq-stock-fell-96-this-week/,"
What happened
Nasdaq (NDAQ -0.29%) had a bumpy ride this week, its share price plummeting 9.6% as of Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. ET, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nasdaq was trading at about $52 per share at the market open on Friday, down about 15% year to date. 
It dropped in what turned out to be a solid week for the markets as the S&P 500 had gained 3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite had jumped 3.9% this week on Friday at the opening bell.
So what
Nasdaq, the company that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, made a big splash this week, announcing on Monday that it was acquiring Adenza, a software company that offers risk management and regulatory compliance services for companies. In other words, it tracks companies' spending and makes sure they're in compliance. 

Nasdaq bought Adenza from software company Thoma Bravo for $10.5 billion, making this the biggest acquisition (in terms of price) in the company's history. That turned out to be the rub, as some analysts and investors thought Nasdaq, which already has significant long-term debt, overpaid for this company. 
The move sparked a sell-off, and the share price dropped some 10% after the news came out, down to below $50 per share.




Now what
Purchase price aside, the acquisition itself is part of Nasdaq's strategy to expand its offerings beyond the stock exchange to give itself multiple revenue streams and provide some stable income. The stock exchange business can be pretty volatile.
""This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading software company that enhances Nasdaq's position at the heart of the global financial system,"" said Adena Friedman, chair and CEO of Nasdaq.
Adenza is expected to generate about $590 million in revenue this year, with 15% organic revenue growth and 18% annual recurring revenue growth. Also, the company has a loyal clientele, boasting a 98% gross retention rate with 80% recurring revenue. It should boost revenue for Nasdaq's Solutions Businesses from 71% of total revenue to 77%. 
While the debt is a concern, this looks like a good business and a strategic fit, and with the extra revenue along with the already high margins and operating cash flow, Nasdaq should be able to handle it and prosper. This is actually a pretty good time to consider buying Nasdaq stock, as the forward price-to-earnings ratio is down to 18 after the sell-off.

NDAQ,Why Nasdaq Stock Was Falling Today,"Jun 12, 2023",4:11PM,2023-11-28 07:30:44.080736,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/12/why-nasdaq-stock-was-falling-today/,"
What happened
Typically, when investors talk about Nasdaq (NDAQ -0.29%), they are referring to the Nasdaq Composite index, or perhaps the abridged Nasdaq-100, but Nasdaq is also a company that runs the eponymous exchange, and today its stock was tumbling.
As of 3:12 p.m. ET, the stock was down 11.3% on news that it would buy financial software company Adenza from Thoma Bravo for $10.5 billion.

So what
The deal would be the biggest ever for the stock market exchange, and the company argued that it accelerates its ""strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system."" 
The deal is in keeping with CEO Adena Friedman's aim to transition the company from an exchange operator, which is sensitive to trading volumes, to a more tech-forward company with steady revenue streams. 
Adenza provides risk-management and regulatory software for the financial services sector, and the company is expected to bring in $590 million this year, giving it a price-to-sales ratio of about 18. It's also expected to deliver 15% organic revenue growth and a 58% adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin. 




The deal with Thoma Bravo, which is a private equity firm known for buying software companies, is a cash-and-stock deal that will give it a 14.9% stake in Nasdaq. 
Now what
The market's reaction seemed to indicate that investors thought Nasdaq was overpaying for the company, and it may also be skeptical of the deal regardless of the price tag. 
Adenza resulted from the merger of two software companies, Calypso and Axiom, that Thoma Bravo had previously acquired. It's unclear how much Thoma Bravo paid for them, but the deal is likely a win for the PE firm. 
At this point, it seems too early to judge the wisdom of the acquisition, but at roughly 40% of Nasdaq's market cap, it's a steep price for the financial services company. 




The deal will dilute shareholders and add to the company's debt burden, but Nasdaq expects it to be accretive to earnings after two years.

NDAQ,What Is a Stock Ticker?,"Apr 19, 2023",5:40PM,2023-11-28 07:30:52.818779,https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-ticker/,"

Stock ticker symbols are codes that represent publicly traded companies in the stock market. Although a stock's ticker, strictly speaking, is distinct from its ticker symbol, most investors use the term stock ticker as shorthand for its ticker symbol. The ticker itself is the constantly updating stream of information about a stock, and the ticker symbol is its code, consisting of between one and four letters.




Image source: The Motley Fool.



Stock ticker codes or symbols were originally created to shorten publicly traded company names on ticker tape printed by brokerage houses. Today, a stock ticker helps you search for a specific stock online and perhaps make a trade using your brokerage's website.Although most stock ticker symbols are composed of three or four letters, some older companies have one- or two-letter tickers. Mutual funds and many foreign companies have five-letter ticker symbols. Most ticker symbols are either abbreviations of companies' names -- such as ABNB for Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) -- or somehow related to the company, such as Petco's (NASDAQ:WOOF) clever choice of WOOF.


How to read stock ticker symbolsReading a stock ticker is usually pretty easy. Let's use Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an example. The company's legal name, which is the same name the company uses to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is Netflix, Inc. The stock exchange it trades on is the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ), and the streaming entertainment company's ticker symbol is NFLX.This information, taken together, and with the addition of the stock price and information about its recent movement, is the stock's ticker -- at least in the strictest sense. ""NFLX"" is customarily referred to as the company's ticker despite being only the symbol representing Netflix on the Nasdaq exchange.Types of stock tickersEach stock exchange sets the rules for the length and format of its stock ticker symbols, which is why variations in stock tickers exist. As previously noted, most stock tickers are three or four letters, and some stock exchanges allow numbers. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) allows as many as four letters, and the Nasdaq allows up to five.Some stock ticker symbols also include modifiers, which are additional (usually fifth) letters or letters following periods in the symbols. Modifiers can be used to express the type of security, such as a mutual fund; the type of stock, such as a preferred stock; or the class of stock, which denotes shareholder privileges.Companies create different classes of shares to allow the management team to hold a higher percentage of the vote than they do equity in the company. This way, investors still receive something for their investment, but management maintains control over decisions.





Stock ticker examples While every stock exchange has its own rules for ticker symbols, it's helpful to understand broadly how stock tickers can appear. Most of the variation is caused by the modifiers, which below are explained from A to Z:A: Denotes the Class A version of a stock, which confers certain rights and privileges to shareholders that may not be available to holders of other classes of a company's stock.B: Denotes the Class B version of a stock, which generally confers fewer rights and privileges than Class A stock, or it may be priced to be affordable to individual investors.C: Indicates that a company no longer meets the listing requirements of a stock exchange but has not yet been delisted.D: Signifies newly issued shares or a reverse stock split. E: Assigned to companies that are delinquent in filing with the SEC.F: Reserved for companies listed on foreign exchanges.G: For first convertible bonds, which can be converted into shares of stock at a specified stock price. First convertible bond owners are paid first in the event of asset liquidation or bankruptcy.H: For second convertible bonds, which also are convertible into stock. Second convertible bond owners are paid second in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy.I: Denotes third convertible bonds, which are convertible into stock and whose owners are paid third and last in the event of bankruptcy.J: Used by the Nasdaq exchange to denote, in relation to shareholder votes, which stocks have voting rights.K: Used by the Nasdaq exchange in the same context to denote the absence of shareholder voting rights.L: Something of a catch-all variation and used differently by different exchanges.M: For fourth-class preferred shares, which are preferred shares that have the fourth-highest dividend payment priority in the event of a cash shortfall for a company. Preferred shares are a type of fixed-income security that pays a guaranteed dividend, unlike common shares.N: Denotes third-class preferred shares, for which guaranteed dividends are paid ahead of fourth-class preferred shares.O: Signifies second-class preferred shares, which have the second-strongest guarantee of the dividend being paid.P: For first-class preferred shares, which have the most liquidity because the dividend guarantee is the strongest.Q: Indicates a company that has filed for bankruptcy protection.R: Denotes a stock rights offering, which is designed to enable a company to issue additional shares of stock without diluting existing shareholders' ownership percentages. Stock rights allow existing shareholders only to buy new shares of a stock at a lower price than new buyers.S: Shares of beneficial interest, which are a security type that confers the right to the income generated by an asset without transferring ownership of the asset itself.T: Denotes stock warrants or rights. Warrants are a lot like stock options.U: Used for new issues and typically groups shares of a stock, along with any warrants or rights that have been attached.V: Denotes stock that is trading before it has been formally issued. The Nasdaq exchange permits some institutional investors to buy stocks ""when issued"" that will soon have their initial public offerings, or IPOs. The trade is made official after the IPO.W: For warrants to buy a stock. Note that sometimes WS will be used instead of W, but there is no difference.X: Used by all mutual funds.Y: Indicates the stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR), a type of security that allows foreign stocks to trade on U.S. exchanges. The company still trades on a foreign exchange, with the ADR converting the stock's foreign value to dollars for U.S. investors.Z: Another letter that is used differently by different exchanges.A few other modifiers are:OB: Short for over-the-counter (OTC) bulletin board, which denotes a stock that trades on the OTC market.PK: Stands for pink sheet, synonymous with OTC. Both pink sheet and OTC stocks do not trade on major exchanges but via broker networks (that formerly relied on actual pink sheets of paper).SC: Denotes a company trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets exchange, which is smaller and has less stringent listing requirements.Note that many of these modifiers apply only to quotations directly from stock exchanges, and you are not likely to see them as a nonprofessional investor. Here are some of the stock ticker modifiers you are likely to see:

NDAQ,The Bear Takes a Bite Out of Nasdaq Shares,"Jan 28, 2023",5:45AM,2023-11-28 07:31:00.697971,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/28/the-bear-takes-a-bite-out-of-nasdaq/,"
The past year has been difficult for the stock and bond markets, as anyone who tracked the performance of their 401(k) can attest. The bear market also was a negative for the companies that own the stock exchanges.
Over the past year, Nasdaq (NDAQ -0.29%) has taken steps to reduce its reliance on services that rise and fall with the stock market. The stock was rocked by disappointing earnings, however the company laid out how some of its new initiatives will reduce its correlation with markets.

Nasdaq focuses on serving the capital markets and financial industries. The company offers data and analytics as well as software and services. It recently reorganized into three operating segments: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime. The market platforms segment includes trading and market technology. The capital access platform segment includes listing services, indexes, and workflow solutions including environmental and social governance (ESG). Finally, the anti-financial crime segment offers a software solution that helps financial institutions monitor and detect fraud and money laundering.

The ups and downs of the stock market are the biggest drivers of performance
Market platforms accounts for just over two-thirds of Nasdaq's revenue and it is tied to the stock market's fortunes. Unfortunately for the company, trading volume usually declines in a bear market. During a bull market, investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs) usually increases. Index revenue, which is based on assets under management, also rises and falls with the fortunes of the stock market. This is one of the reasons Nasdaq is focusing on diversifying away from businesses that are tightly tied to market movement. 
Nasdaq is taking steps to diversify its offerings
The anti-financial crime segment is by far the smallest segment; however, it is experiencing much faster growth than the other divisions. In the fourth quarter, the segment increased revenue by 21%, and operating margin increased from 25% to 32%. Financial crime is a major focus of regulators and banks, which run the risk of running afoul of regulators if they have insufficient policies and procedures to detect and address financial fraud and money laundering. Nasdaq sees this as an $18 billion total addressable market, which it has only begun to penetrate. This segment is expected to grow at above-market rates for the foreseeable future and Nasdaq sees it as a core growth area. 




Workflow and insights includes the recent acquisition of Metrio, an ESG data and reporting platform. ESG continues to be an important consideration for many investors and Nasdaq sees this as a big growth area. 
Disappointing numbers, but the company should be a steady performer going forward
Nasdaq's earnings did disappoint, and Wall Street was unhappy with the company's forecast for a 5% rise in operating costs next year. That said, revenue rose 7.8% although earnings per share fell from $0.51 to $0.48. The company did hike the quarterly dividend as well. Nasdaq didn't give much to work with in terms of outlook. While anti-financial crime and ESG represent areas that should grow regardless of the stock market, the overall business of stock trading, data, technology, and issuer services will drive the business. Nasdaq still has a strong competitive moat and has little competition aside from Intercontinental Exchange. 
Nasdaq is trading at 22.4 times expected 2023 earnings per share. This is a reasonable multiple for a market-leading company that has a competitive moat and very little competition. The dividend yield of 1.4% isn't likely to attract income investors. Still, Nasdaq is a steady performer with some interesting growth possibilities, though its overall performance still depend on the stock market.

NDAQ,1 Under-the-Radar Growth Stock to Buy and Hold,"Aug 3, 2022",8:41AM,2023-11-28 07:31:10.880781,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/03/under-the-radar-growth-stock-buy-and-hold-nasdaq/,"
When you think of Nasdaq (NDAQ -0.29%), you probably think of the exchange or its indices, which are the leading benchmarks for technology and growth stocks. However, Nasdaq Inc. is also a company that itself trades on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. And while the exchange is a household name for investors, Nasdaq's stock largely flies under the radar compared to other tech stocks.
The stock is, in fact, beating the exchange it owns, trading down about 14% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite is off 20% as of Aug. 1. Here is why Nasdaq, the stock, stands out on Nasdaq, the exchange.
A 3-for-1 stock split to take effect this month
Nasdaq is currently trading at about $180 per share, but that will soon change as the company has been approved for a 3-for-1 stock split. That means that every shareholder as of Aug. 12 will get two additional shares for each already owned, but each share will be worth about $60. The split will take place after the markets close Aug. 26 and start trading on Aug. 29. 
As Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman explained on the first-quarter earnings conference call, the split invites more investors to own shares because the entry price is lower, and it creates greater liquidity and more trading on the exchange ""as opposed to through these fractional share offerings are all off-exchange."" And because Nasdaq earns revenue when shares are traded in the U.S., stock splits are good for the company, because they generally encourage more trading. 

The market has reacted positively to the news as the stock is up roughly 12.2% since the second-quarter earnings report came out on July 20, along with the announcement of the final approvals and dates for the stock split. In the month of July, Nasdaq was a market mover, up 18.6%. 




Nasdaq has diverse revenue streams
News of the stock split aside, Nasdaq posted solid earnings in the second quarter. Overall, total revenue was up 10% year over year to $1.5 billion while net revenue was up about 6% to $893 million. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share was up 9% year over year to $2.07 -- not counting a net gain on a divestiture a year ago.
While the exchange business is a major revenue generator, what makes Nasdaq an attractive stock is it has four different revenue streams -- with multiple different types of revenue. And all four business segments saw year-over-year revenue increases in the most recent quarter. 
The four segments are:

Market services, which include revenue from trading on the exchanges;
Investment intelligence, which includes market data and intelligence, as well as licensing its indices;
Market technology, which offers technology solutions for institutional investors in the areas of trading and settlement, anti-financial crime, among others; and
Corporate platforms, which include index listing, as well as investor relations and ESG (environmental, social, governance) services.

Nasdaq earns revenue from transaction fees related to trading within the exchanges as well as listing fees for being on the indices. This is recurring revenue and it helps stabilize the bottom line. Another recurring revenue source is subscriptions within its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings in its market technology business. On the second-quarter earnings call, Friedman said SaaS revenue grew 12% year over year to $679 million in the second quarter and now makes up 35% of recurring revenue. ""The consistent growth we're seeing in our recurring revenue segments provides a powerful starting point for our overall performance,"" she said. 




Nasdaq has focused on building out its SaaS and recurring cash flow through these various business segments to not only create more growth opportunities but also to navigate a variety of market cycles -- including bear markets. The growth in these segments has also allowed Nasdaq to improve its operating margin to its highest level since 2016 at 26% and boost its quarterly free cash flow to $570 million in the first quarter -- the highest ever. 
With these growth engines, its capital strength, its dominance among index providers, and its soon-to-be lower entry price, Nasdaq looks like a solid long-term buy right now.

NDAQ,Generate Passive Income as This Dividend Payer Eyes a Stock Split,"Aug 3, 2022",5:45AM,2023-11-28 07:31:18.805110,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/03/generate-passive-income-as-this-dividend-payer-eye/,"
Since 1980, businesses that have announced stock splits have nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 Index over the following 12 months. This figure is pretty shocking, as technically nothing changes within a corporation or about its value when it goes through a split.
So what's going on?
Often, stock splits make high-priced shares more accessible to individual investors -- though that impact is diminishing now that brokers widely offer the option of buying fractional shares. Occasionally, the maneuver is used to position a company to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which requires a lower share price due to its price-weighted formula.
My highly unscientific theory on why stock splits tend to outperform is that most companies ""in need of"" a stock split because their prices have soared are proven winners -- and winners tend to keep winning. 
This idea brings me to Nasdaq (NDAQ -0.29%) and its nearly 700% share price gain over the past decade. It will undergo a 3-for-1 stock split in late August. It, too, could keep on winning -- thanks to its dividend (which at the current share price yields less than 1%), its slim payout ratio of 29%, and its quickly budding software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. 





SaaS stability
While cash equity and equity derivatives trading still accounts for the largest single slice of Nasdaq's sales, its collection of non-trading segments now provides 74% of total revenue. Consisting of Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, and Corporate Platforms segments, the non-trading portion of Nasdaq's business (collectively called its Solutions segment) is a bit of a hidden gem.
Of the revenue generated across the Solutions segment and the non-trading portion of its Market Services segment, around 70% comes from recurring revenue. This is quietly beneficial for Nasdaq because recurring revenue tends to be incredibly sticky and predictable, coming from customers with subscription contracts.
This stability is critical to Nasdaq as it helps balance out the volume-driven lumpiness around its trading revenue and the broader macroeconomic issues that affect its listings business. Nasdaq's annual recurring revenue has grown by an average of 11% a year since 2017, bringing consistent growth to formerly volatile revenue figures. 
Best yet for investors, management expects SaaS sales to account for 40% to 50% of annual recurring revenue by 2025. These SaaS sales should help improve operating margins over time as Nasdaq develops long-term relationships with customers and brings its portfolio of financial services to bear on a land-and-expand strategy.




Since 2016, when SaaS sales amounted to 21% of annual recurring revenue, their share has risen to 35%. Consider the following chart, highlighting how important these growing SaaS sales are.

NDAQ Profit Margin data by YCharts
While five years is a relatively small sample size over the company's history, this chart shows the power of Nasdaq's ongoing transformation. Having widened its profit margin to nearly 20% while seeing its return on equity double to almost 17%, Nasdaq has become a passive income powerhouse for investors.
Passive income potential
An investor who bought Nasdaq 10 years ago when it first started making dividend payments would now be collecting a yield of 10% on their original cost basis, thanks to the company's track record of payout increases.

Since dividend-growing stocks with payout ratios below 50% have historically outperformed the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq's blend of steady top-line growth and increasing returns to shareholders should be a winning combination over the long haul.
Despite rough macroeconomic conditions, in Q2, Nasdaq's net revenue grew by 6% year over year, and its non-GAAP earnings per share rose by 9%. These results highlight the resilience of its recurring revenue and its SaaS focus, which compensated for a drop in trading revenue.
Thanks to this diversification and the steady growth provided by its Solutions segment, Nasdaq should be a stock-splitting winner that keeps on winning, generating increasing levels of dividend income along the way.
